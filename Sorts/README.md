# Sorting algorithms

## Working:

* [Bubble sort](#bubble-sort)
* [Insertion sort](#insertion-sort)

## Bubble sort
#### Presentation
Bubble sort is comparing adjacent numbers: if the compared pair is in the wrong order, it gets swapped, and then the algorithm is comparing the next two numbers. This process is repeated until the whole array is sorted.
#### Complexity
* Best case: *O(n)* as the algorithm is comparing each pair at least once
* Worst case: *O(n<sup>2</sup>)*

## Insertion sort
#### Presentation
Insertion sort iterates over each element, removes it from the array to place it at the correct sorted position. This process is repeated until the whole array is sorted.
#### Complexity
* Best case: *O(n)* 
* Worst case: *O(n<sup>2</sup>)*

## TBA:

* Merge sort
* Heapsort
* Quicksort
* Shellsort
* Exchange sort
* Comb sort
* Radix sort
