# Python Algorithm Training & Testing
---
![Build Status](https://github.com/Legoota/PythonAlgorithmTraining/workflows/pytest/badge.svg)
## Purpose

* Discover and try to work on algorithms from various subjects (graph theory, number sorting, ...)
* Mastering big O notation
* Training with Python
* Working with Github Actions to automate Python testing

## Why Python ?

I decided to use Python as it is an easy to read language, ideal for functional programming. Although it is not a perfect choice performance-wise, it is still usable to work on algorithm complexity.

## Testing

For testing purposes, the chosen tool is [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/).

## Structure of the project

This project is structured as follows:
.
 * Graphs
   * Graph structure (vertices, edges)
   * Graph algorithms
 * Matrices
   * Matrix structure
   * Matrix algorithms
 * Sorts
   * Sorting algorithms
 * Strings
   * String algorithms
 * Tests
   * Graphs
     * Graph algorithms tests
   * Matrices
     * Matrix algorithms tests
   * Sorts
     * Sorting algorithms tests
   * Strings
     * String algorithms tests

Each folder (except ```Tests/```) contains a ```README``` file explaining the different algorithms available, or TBA, with some information and documentation.
